- 👋 Hi, I’m @duck57
- 👀 I’m interested in quacking, playing rhythms in 5/4 time, brogramming, petting my rabbit, and 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir & Cloujure.  Common Lisp is on my to-learn pile, who knows when I'll get around to it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on writing music (or code)
- 📫 Send a carrier pigeon or use smoke signals.
